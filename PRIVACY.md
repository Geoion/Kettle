# Privacy Policy

## Overview

Kettle is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our application.

## Data Collection

### Analytics Data (Optional)

### Local Data

Kettle stores the following data locally on your device:
- Cache of Homebrew packages, taps, and services
- App preferences

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly enable analytics.

## Data Usage

If analytics is enabled, we use the collected data to:
- Improve app performance
- Identify and fix bugs
- Understand feature usage

## Data Protection

We use Google Analytics for Firebase, which:

- Complies with GDPR and other privacy regulations

## User Control

You have complete control over data collection:
- Analytics is disabled by default
- You can enable/disable analytics at any time in Settings
- You can reset or clear all local data

## Third-Party Services

The only third-party service we use is Google Analytics for Firebase when analytics is enabled. No other third-party services receive your data.
